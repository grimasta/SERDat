1480ad9ce77285eb8559afc5b33d35c348f063a7,master,dts: edtlib: Sanity-check the final merged binding onlySanity-checking each !included file separately was inherited from theold scripts. It makes it messy to check that combinations of fields makesense e.g. to check 'const:' or 'default:' against 'type:' since thosefields might come from different files (this is handy since it makessense to just add/change a 'const:' value for example).Drop the requirement that each !included file is a complete binding initself and treat them as binding fragments instead. Only check thefinal merged binding.This also means that !included files no longer need to have a'description:' or 'title:' (those have always been unused for !includedfiles) so remove those and add comments that explain what thefragments are for instead.

Later on I'm planning to mass-replace it add a deprecationwarning if it's used and document 'include:'. Then the '!include'implementation can be removed a bit later.'!include' has caused issues in the past (see the comment above theadd_constructor() call) gets iffy with multiple EDT instances andmakes the code harder to follow.I'm guessing '!include' might've been intended to be useful outside of'inherits:' originally but that's the only place where it's used. It'sundocumented that it's possible to put it elsewhere.To implement the backwards compatibility the code just transforms    inherits:        !include foo.dtsinto    inherits:        - foo.dtsand treats 'inherits:' similarly to 'include:'.

6564974bae1db024e9f89647b927388d4a20a728,master,userspace: Support for split 64 bit argumentsSystem call arguments at the arch layer are single words.  Sopassing wider values requires splitting them into two registers atcall time.  This gets even more complicated for values (e.gk_timeout_t) that may have different sizes depending on configuration.This patch adds a feature to gen_syscalls.py to detect functions withwide arguments and automatically generates code to split/unsplit them.Unfortunately the current scheme of Z_SYSCALL_DECLARE_* macros won'twork with functions like this because for N arguments (our currentmaximum N is 10) there are 2^N possible configurations of argumentwidths.  So this generates the complete functions for each handler andwrapper effectively doing in python what was originally done in thepreprocessor.Another complexity is that traditional the z_hdlr_*() function for asystem call has taken the raw list of word arguments which does notwork when some of those arguments must be 64 bit types.  So instead ofusing a single Z_SYSCALL_HANDLER macro this splits the job ofz_hdlr_*() into two steps: An automatically-generated unmarshallingfunction z_mrsh_*() which then calls a user-supplied verificationfunction z_vrfy_*().  The verification function is typesafe and is asimple C function with exactly the same argument and return signatureas the syscall impl function.  It is also not responsible forvalidating the pointers to the extra parameter array or a wide returnvalue that code gets automatically generated.This commit includes new vrfy/msrh handling for all syscalls invokedduring CI runs.  Future commits will port the less testable code.Signed-off-by: Andy Ross <andrew.j.ross@intel.com>,['1846fc600fde147937cca84d0476d31f2a8414db'],andyross,2019-08-06 20:34:31+00:00,nashif,2019-09-12 03:31:50+00:00,739,972,36,False,False,False,False,doc/reference/usermode/syscalls.rst,doc/reference/usermode/syscalls.rst,47,210,66261e68-9fc4-11ec-b490-482ae32cf5b4

6564974bae1db024e9f89647b927388d4a20a728,master,userspace: Support for split 64 bit argumentsSystem call arguments at the arch layer are single words.  Sopassing wider values requires splitting them into two registers atcall time.  This gets even more complicated for values (e.gk_timeout_t) that may have different sizes depending on configuration.This patch adds a feature to gen_syscalls.py to detect functions withwide arguments and automatically generates code to split/unsplit them.Unfortunately the current scheme of Z_SYSCALL_DECLARE_* macros won'twork with functions like this because for N arguments (our currentmaximum N is 10) there are 2^N possible configurations of argumentwidths.

So instead ofusing a single Z_SYSCALL_HANDLER macro this splits the job ofz_hdlr_*() into two steps: An automatically-generated unmarshallingfunction z_mrsh_*() which then calls a user-supplied verificationfunction z_vrfy_*().  The verification function is typesafe and is asimple C function with exactly the same argument and return signatureas the syscall impl function.  It is also not responsible forvalidating the pointers to the extra parameter array or a wide returnvalue that code gets automatically generated.This commit includes new vrfy/msrh handling for all syscalls invokedduring CI runs.

6564974bae1db024e9f89647b927388d4a20a728,master,userspace: Support for split 64 bit argumentsSystem call arguments at the arch layer are single words.  Sopassing wider values requires splitting them into two registers atcall time.  This gets even more complicated for values (e.gk_timeout_t) that may have different sizes depending on configuration.This patch adds a feature to gen_syscalls.py to detect functions withwide arguments and automatically generates code to split/unsplit them.Unfortunately the current scheme of Z_SYSCALL_DECLARE_* macros won'twork with functions like this because for N arguments (our currentmaximum N is 10) there are 2^N possible configurations of argumentwidths.  So this generates the complete functions for each handler andwrapper effectively doing in python what was originally done in thepreprocessor.Another complexity is that traditional the z_hdlr_*() function for asystem call has taken the raw list of word arguments which does notwork when some of those arguments must be 64 bit types.  So instead ofusing a single Z_SYSCALL_HANDLER macro this splits the job ofz_hdlr_*() into two steps: An automatically-generated unmarshallingfunction z_mrsh_*() which then calls a user-supplied verificationfunction z_vrfy_*().

The result is that in C the sizeofvalue of struct k_spinlock is 0 and in C++ it is 1.This size difference causes problems when the k_spinlockis embedded into another struct like k_msgq because C andC++ will have different ideas on the offsets of the membersthat come after the k_spinlock member.To prevent this we add a 1 byte dummy member to k_spinlockwhen the user selects C++ support and k_spinlock wouldotherwise be empty.Signed-off-by: Erwin Rol <erwin@erwinrol.com>,['871d132577729b69bf296f9f04735597a6a2f6bd'],lowlander,2019-09-15 18:33:14+00:00,maureenhelm,2019-09-16 19:34:24+00:00,17,0,1,False,True,True,False,include/spinlock.h,include/spinlock.h,17,0,662a8862-9fc4-11ec-96bd-482ae32cf5b4

We used the hlist directive toaccomplish list but it has a drawback on small (phone) screens becauseunder the hood the rendering is done using tables.Instead we can take advantage of built-in CSS multi-column supportavailable in recent browsers.  So convert uses of the hlist directiveto use an rst-class directive to apply a multi-column class tothe entity. The chosen column-width (18em) gives us a 3-column displayon typical window sizes but will adjust to more or fewer columnsdepending on the actual real estate available.Also update the documentation guidelines to mention this change.Signed-off-by: David B.

4c6ea2d1601d7dc7f71ca90f508dcf21feb8fa27,master,scripts: edtlib: Skip fully loading bindings in more casesAs a slightly hairy but important optimization inherited from the oldscripts the binding loading code only looks at binding files whose rawtext contains one of the compatible strings from the devicetree. Forsuch files a second pass parses the file as YAML and tries to extract acompatible string and skips the file if it fails (e.g. due to spurioustext matches in 'include'd binding fragments).Until now the binding would always get fully loaded (have 'include'dfiles merged in checks run etc.) if the second pass managed to extracta compatible.Do slightly better by only fully loading the binding if the extractedcompatible from the second pass appears in the devicetree. This gets ridof unnecessary binding loading in rare cases.Discovered by test-bindings/deprecated.yaml getting loaded even wheneverything that referenced it in test.dts was commented out because ithappened to mention 'child-binding' in a comment.Also add a check for YAML errors in the second pass to be slightly morerobust. Print a warning if a file that isn't valid YAML is found.Signed-off-by: Ulf Magnusson <Ulf.Magnusson@nordicsemi.no>,['b5fad775548486e89539916abaa90279adffd3f6'],ulfalizer,2019-09-19 20:54:55+00:00,galak,2019-09-22 14:17:53+00:00,14,5,1,False,True,True,False,scripts/dts/edtlib.py,scripts/dts/edtlib.py,14,5,663ca440-9fc4-11ec-87dc-482ae32cf5b4

b0158cc81fa60ce674acfaa9d968797400dac45e,master,kernel/sched: Fix reschedule points in SMPThere were two related bugs when in SMP mode:1. Underneath z_reschedule() the code was inexplicably checking the   swap_ok flag on the current CPU to see if it was OK to preempt the   current thread but reschedule is the DEFINITION of a schedule   point and we always want to swap even if the current thread is   non-preemptible.2. With similar symptoms: in k_yield() a previous fix correct the   queue handling for SMP but it missed the case where a thread of   the SAME priority as _current was on the queue and would fail to   swap.  Yielding must always add the current thread to the back of   the current priority.Signed-off-by: Andy Ross <andrew.j.ross@intel.com>,['dba3555ffb0972ba917a0a3aac8678c084c69232'],andyross,2019-08-16 20:14:51+00:00,nashif,2019-09-26 20:54:06+00:00,2,5,1,False,True,True,False,kernel/sched.c,kernel/sched.c,2,5,6619caf3-9fc4-11ec-8e66-482ae32cf5b4

b97ed9e4b4307fa119e009f640e8fda3f3ee5d15,master,scripts: dts: Generalize handling of phandle-array typesGenerating generic information for 'type: phandle-array' properties inedtlib was difficult due to defining phandle-array as just a list ofphandles and numbers. To make sense of a phandle-array property like'pwms' you have to know that #pwm-cells is expected to appear oneach referenced controller and that the binding for the controller hasa #cells.Because of this handling of various 'type: phandle-array' propertieswas previously hardcoded in edtlib and exposed through properties likeNode.pwms instead of through the generic Node.props (though with a lotof shared code).In practice it turns out that all 'type: phandle-array' properties inZephyr work exactly the same way: They all have names that end in -sthe 's' is removed to derive the name of related properties and theyall look up #cells in the binding for the controller which gives namesto the data values.Strengthen the definition of 'type: phandle-array' to mean a propertythat works exactly like the existing phandle-array properties (whichalso means requiring that the name ends in -s).

83fc06a8feb6074d1baaa0e93c56e4de76c578bb,master,sanitycheck: Complete overhaul and job handling reworkA complete overhaul of the sanitycheck script and how we build and runtests. This new version of sanitycheck uses python for job distributionand drop use of Make.In addition to the move to python threading library the following hasbeen changed:- All handlers now run in parallel meaning that any simulator will runin parallel and when testing on multiple devices (using--device-testing) the tests are run in parallel.- Lexicial filtering (using the filter keyword in yaml files) is nowevaluated at runtime and is no long being pre-processed. This will allowus to immediately start executing tests and skip the wait time that wasneeded for filtering.- Device testing now supports multiple devices connected at the sametime and is managed using a hardware map that needs to be generated andmaintained for every test environment.
